This app is structured from 2 main modules, the user module and the social_media module.
At first, when user has to register, the social_media register_user function is registering him by adding him to the
list of all the users.
Then, this user can do 2 operations by the user module: post_message and follow another users.
Finally, by the generate_timeline function, the user can view the posts that the following users posted.
